# New Editor (NEd)
Terminal-based \*nix text editor with a really dumb working title.

## Building
Clone, `make`, binary is written as `ned`.

## Usage
Ned can open existing files or start with an empty buffer. The buffer can be edited, but changes cannot be saved.

Run using `ned <filename>`. Arrow keys navigate through the file, Page Up and Page Down to scroll, Home and End snap to beginning/end of line. Ctrl-Q to quit.
