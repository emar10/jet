# New Editor (NEd)
Terminal-based \*nix text editor with a really dumb working title.

## Building
Clone, `make`, binary is written as `ned`.

## Usage
At present, `ned` can only display text files.

Run using `ned <filename`. Arrow keys navigate through the file, Page Up and Page Down to scroll, Home and End snap to beginning/end of line. Ctrl-Q to quit.
